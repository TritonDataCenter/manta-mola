# Makefile: basic Makefile for template API service
#
# This Makefile is a template for new repos. It contains only repo-specific
# logic and uses included makefiles to supply common targets (javascriptlint,
# jsstyle, restdown, etc.), which are used by other repos as well. You may well
# need to rewrite most of this file, but you shouldn't need to touch the
# included makefiles.
#
# If you find yourself adding support for new targets that could be useful for
# other projects too, you should add these to the original versions of the
# included Makefiles (in eng.git) so that other teams can use them too.
